## Common business problems

 Business process modeled in software are often called workflows.

 Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems.

 - Logic Apps.
 - Microsoft Flow.
 - WebJobs
 - Azure Functions

 They can all:

 - Accept inputs.
 - Run actions.
 - Include conditions.
 - Produce outputs.

 ### Design-first technologies

 Logic Apps is a service that you can use to automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components of a distributed application.You can create or edit in JSON notation.

 You can draw out complex workflows that model complex business processes. 
 
 Microsoft Flow is built on Logic Apps. Flow supports the same range of connectors and actions and is more appropriate for use by non-technical staff.
